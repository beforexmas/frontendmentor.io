# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

Hi 👋!

I did this challenge trying to use clean 🧼 and intelligible 💡 HTML/CSS code.

"Sadly" 😢 I had to use some JS to implement the logic behind the rating stars selection and the update of the counter in the last page.

I'm aware there are few CSS tricks ✨ that will allow to not involve any JS code, but I preferred readability 📖 over "freshness" 💃.

Comments and criticisms are really welcome. 
So I beg you, spit out your venom 🐍!!
